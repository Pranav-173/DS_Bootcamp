# Heap Sort:
## What it is?
Heap Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure (usually a max-heap) to sort elements. It works by first building a heap from the array, then repeatedly extracting the maximum element and placing it at the end of the array.
## Algorithm (step-by-step):
Given array `A[0..n-1]`:
1. Step 1: Build Max Heap
- Convert the array into a max heap (parent ≥ children).
- Start from the last non-leaf node and heapify each node up to the root.
2. Step 2: Extract Elements
- For i = n-1 down to 1:
- Swap A[0] (largest element) with A[i].
- Reduce heap size by 1.
- Heapify the root (A[0]) to maintain heap property.
## Time complexity:
- **Best case:** `O(n log n)`
- **Average case:** `O(n log n)`.
- **Worst case:** `O(n log n)` 
## Space complexity:
- Auxiliary: `O(1)` - in-place.
### Other notes:
- **Stable:** No (relative order of equal elements may change). 
- **When to use:**
  - Useful when consistent O(n log n) performance is required.
  - Good for large datasets.
  - Preferred when memory usage must be minimal.
