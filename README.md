# `DS_Bootcamp`
This repository contains Java implementations of **Data Structures and Algorithms** developed during a Data Structures Bootcamp.  
It is designed to help understand core concepts through clean, readable, and beginner-friendly code.
The implementations prioritize simplicity and correctness over heavy optimization, making them suitable for learning, revision, and interview preparation.
## Repository Overview:
The repository is organized into folders based on topic for better navigation and clarity.
## Data-Structures:
**This directory contains implementations of fundamental data structures in Java, including:**
- Linked Lists.
- Singly Linked Lists.
- Circular Linked Lists.
- Stacks.
- Queues.
- Binary Tree.
- Binary Search Tree.
- AVL Tree.
- Graphs :
  - Adjaceny Matrix.
  - Adjacency List.
  - DFS algorithm.
  - BFS algorithm.
  - Spanning Tree.
  - Minimum Spanning Tree.
  - Kruskal's algorithm.
  - Prim's algorithm.

## Searching-algorithms:
**This directory includes Java implementations of common searching techniques:**
- Linear Search.
- Binary Search.
- Uniform Binary Search.
- Fibonacci Search.
- Interpolation Search.
  
The implementations demonstrate how different searching strategies behave under different conditions.
## Sorting-algorithms:
**This directory contains Java implementations of basic sorting algorithms such as:**
- Bubble Sort.
- Selection Sort.
- Insertion Sort.
- Quick Sort.
- Radix Sort.
- Merge Sort.
- Shell Sort.
- Bucket Sort.
- Optimised bubble Sort.
  
These programs are written to clearly show algorithm flow and logic rather than micro-optimizations.
## Notes:
**This directory contains Markdown notes created during the bootcamp sessions.**  
**The notes explain:**
- Key concepts.
- Algorithm intuition.
- Important observations.
- Day wise concepts.
