# DS_Bootcamp

This repository contains Java implementations of **Data Structures and Algorithms** developed during a Data Structures Bootcamp.  
It is designed to help understand core concepts through clean, readable, and beginner-friendly code.

The implementations prioritize simplicity and correctness over heavy optimization, making them suitable for learning, revision, and interview preparation.

## Repository Overview

The repository is organized into folders based on topic for better navigation and clarity.

---

## Data-Structures

This directory contains implementations of fundamental data structures in Java, including:
- Linked Lists
- Singly Linked Lists
- Circular Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Binary Tree

Each implementation focuses on:
- Correct pointer manipulation
- Edge case handling
- Clear method structure

---

## Searching-algorithms

This directory includes Java implementations of common searching techniques:
- Linear Search
- Binary Search
- Uniform Binary Swarch
- Fibonacci Search
- Interpolation Search

The implementations demonstrate how different searching strategies behave under different conditions.

---

## Sorting-algorithms

This directory contains Java implementations of basic sorting algorithms such as:
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Quick Sort
- Radix Sort
- Merge Sort
- Shell Sort

These programs are written to clearly show algorithm flow and logic rather than micro-optimizations.

---

## Notes

This directory contains Markdown notes created during the bootcamp sessions.  
The notes explain:
- Key concepts
- Algorithm intuition
- Important observations
- Common mistakes and edge cases
- Deatiled definitions

---

## Bootcamp.java / Bootcamp_1.java

These files contain practice programs and examples used during learning sessions to test and reinforce concepts covered in the bootcamp.

---
