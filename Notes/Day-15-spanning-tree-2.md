# What is a Spanning Tree?
- A spanning tree is a subset of a graph `G`, which has all the vertices covered with minimum possible number of edges.
- **Example:**
```
		A         A          A         A
	   / \  =>   / \  (or)  /    (or)   \
	  C---B     C   B      C---B     C---B
```
### Applications of Spanning Tree:
- Civil Network Planning.
- Computer Network Routing Protocol.
- Cluster Analysis.
