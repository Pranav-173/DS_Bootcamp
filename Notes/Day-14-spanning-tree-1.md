# Spanning Tree:
- It is a subset of an undirected graph that contains all the vertices of the graph connected with the minimum number of edges.
- Precisely, the edges of the spanning tree form a subset of the edges in the original graph.
- If all the vertices are connected in a graph, then there exists at least one spanning tree. In fact, in a connected graph, there may exist more than one spanning tree.
# Dijkstra's Algorithm:
Given a ***weighted undirected*** graph and a source vertex ***`src`***. We need to find the shortest path distances from the source vertex to all other vertices in the graph.  
***Note:*** The given graph does not contain any negative edge.
